# In your terminal, watch for these successful log entries:
‚úÖ PayPal Client initialized
‚úÖ Creating payment order for: { serviceId: '...', bookingDate: '...', hours: ... }
‚úÖ Service price: $XXX for service: MEDIUM WHITE SET 13x13
‚úÖ Using default city: [City Name]
‚úÖ Created party: [party-id]
‚úÖ Created party service: [party-service-id]
‚úÖ Created offer: [offer-id]
‚úÖ Created transaction: [transaction-id]
‚úÖ Payment order created
‚úÖ Payment captured successfully
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**1. "Service not found" (404)**
- ‚ùå Problem: Wrong service ID being passed
- ‚úÖ Solution: Fixed - now passes correct serviceId from booking data

**2. "City argument missing" (500)**
- ‚ùå Problem: Service has null cityId
- ‚úÖ Solution: Fixed - uses getDefaultCity() when cityId is missing

**3. "userId: undefined" in notification**
- ‚ùå Problem: Using transaction.offer.provider.userId instead of .id
- ‚úÖ Solution: Fixed - now uses transaction.offer.provider.id

**4. "Window closed before response"**
- ‚ùå Problem: PayPal form error due to failed API calls
- ‚úÖ Solution: Fixed - all API calls now work properly

**5. Duplicate credit card fields**
- ‚ùå Problem: Multiple PayPal form initializations
- ‚úÖ Solution: Fixed - comprehensive duplicate prevention

## üéØ Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Payment Flow Should Work When:
1. Service loads without errors
2. Booking modal opens and accepts input
3. Payment form initializes with 4 credit card fields
4. Test card details can be entered successfully
5. Payment submits without "Window closed" error
6. Success message appears
7. Database records are created properly
8. Notifications are sent to provider

### üìä Database Verification
After successful payment, check that these records were created:

- **Prisma Studio**: http://localhost:5556 (if running)

## üéâ Expected Final Result
- Payment completes successfully
- Provider receives notification about new booking
- Client sees success message
- All database records are properly created
- No "Window closed" or server errors
