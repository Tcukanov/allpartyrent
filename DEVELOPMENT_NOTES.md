## Service Creation Issues

### City ID Requirement (Fixed on May 27, 2024)
- **Issue**: Service creation was failing with a 500 error because cityId was required by the API but wasn't being properly included in the form data.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Initially added a City selection dropdown to the create service form
  2. Later completely removed the city requirement from both UI and database (schema updated to make cityId optional)
  3. Updated API to handle null cityId values

### City Removal (May 27, 2024)
- The city field has been completely removed from the service creation form
- The database schema has been updated to make cityId optional (nullable)
- The city relationship in the Prisma schema is now optional
- These changes were made because city information is not being used in the public listings

## Other Important Notes

### Color Filters
- The color selection UI uses a mapping object to display colors correctly
- Check `src/app/provider/services/create/page.tsx` for implementation details
