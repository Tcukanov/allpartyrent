## üöÄ HOW TO TEST

### 1. **Provider Onboarding Test**
1. Go to `/provider/dashboard/paypal`
2. Click "Connect PayPal Account"
3. Fill in the form and submit
4. You'll be redirected to PayPal sandbox for onboarding
5. Complete the flow and return to see status

### 2. **Payment Flow Test**
1. Ensure provider has connected PayPal account
2. Make a booking and try payment
3. Verify order creation includes proper line items
4. Check that BN code appears in PayPal API calls

## üìã NEXT STEPS FOR CERTIFICATION

### 1. **Required for PayPal Certification**
- [ ] Test seller onboarding flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify all API calls include BN code
- [ ] Test payment flows with connected sellers
- [ ] Implement webhook handling for status updates

### 2. **PayPal Requirements Checklist**
- [x] BN Code in environment variables
- [x] BN Code in JS SDK script tag
- [x] BN Code in API headers
- [x] Proper line item details in orders
- [x] Seller onboarding API implementation
- [x] Seller status checking

### 3. **Integration Walkthrough (IWT) Preparation**
When ready for PayPal certification, you'll need to provide:

**API Samples**: Examples of your API calls with headers and bodies
**Recordings**: Videos showing successful/failed onboarding and payment flows
**Questionnaire**: Answers about logo usage, token management, etc.

## üîç VERIFICATION COMMANDS

Check if BN code is properly set:
```bash
grep -r "NYCKIDSPARTYENT_SP_PPCP" src/
```

Check environment variable:
```bash
grep "PAYPAL_PARTNER_ATTRIBUTION_ID" .env.local
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Restart your development server** to pick up the new environment variable
